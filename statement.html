      <p style="margin-top:-10;">To make clear at the start: I probably won’t talk about work that I make as “mine”, or as a “practice”. These words seem to introduce reductive binaries to me, and most binaries seem not to have much grounding in reality. I concern myself with the facts of the matter, so the below is just generalisations with respect to things I have made.</p>
      <p>I am not interested in making work that is theory laden, to be understood only by an artistic elite. I am by no means a trained dancer, but dancing feels to me like a very natural, direct way of accessing something internal. My nan might be a bit initially confused when she watches something like <i>Organ Dance</i>, but its not because she hasn’t read the right books and doesn’t “get it” – I think anyone can get something out of work that I make, so long as they aren’t worrying too much about whether what I’m presenting them fits their expectations of capital-A-Art.</p>
      <p>I think this is why music appeals to me as a medium. It’s very accessible. It has a history of being meaningful in some form to an enormous amount of people, irrespective of its conceptual rigour. I appreciate (and try to make) music that is rigorously thought through, where every element is considered – but there’s also always something to be said for music that’s just really funky and makes you want to dance, or whatever. It’s still possible to make music that isn’t making a statement about music as a medium. Which is more than can be said for painting these days.</p>
      <p>I’ve made some work relating to London’s political space, such as <i>Great Green Tour</i> and <i>The Elephant</i>. Space is a major issue for young creative people in the city today, which is probably why every student show is full of walking artists and nomadic architecture and stuff.</p>
      <p>With projects like the Beck Road pilgrimage I am trying to leverage this collective anxiety into something more together, substantial, actions, solutions.</p>
      <p>Collaboration is becoming increasingly important. I’m not a big subscriber to the idea of the Artist, a lone genius in their studio day and night, emerging one day with their Art and placing it on the white walls to be appreciated. It feels weird and narcissistic and unnecessary. I make my most effective stuff around and with other people, whether it’s in shared studio space or in public space.</p>
      <p>But even collaboration is a term I have issues with. I am trying to find a language for talking about work that doesn’t annoy me. I want to stop debating boring semantic binary arguments, individual vs collaborative, art vs not art, accessible vs intelligent, masculine vs feminine, performance vs sculpture, and I think we have lots to learn from the language of queer and non-binary culture but of course binary vs non-binary is itself a binary and we can’t solve anything building semantic islands instead of spectrums which seems to be queer culture’s MO at the moment but I’m just thinking out loud here I don’t know yet</p>
