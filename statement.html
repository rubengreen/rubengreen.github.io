      <p><b>October/November</b></p><br/>
      <p style="margin-top:-10;">The work has comb teeth and fertiliser and patterns and it’s difficult to reconcile right now but bear with:</p>

<p>I see the light failing this time of year making me apathetic and quiet and raise it a work until I’m sick, let me sleep all Christmas missing festivities, never now. I want to speak impossibly densely, spare the disinterested time and give the interested more, to work with, than I could otherwise. Sorry, I am not usually so cryptic, (poetic? even though I’m writing lots now,) in these situations, but I am struggling to clarify, and this is how I seem to articulate in these months. By night, with few words and messy meanings. </p>

<p>It becomes hard to tell what my disappointment with the work is. My brain is either in no state to keep the pace it does other times of year, the juices frozen in their pipes, or jammed with autumn leaves - or I am being unfair, and will remember these objects differently.</p>
<p>But it’s true that these things are comfortable, if not indulgent. What I know works and fits. Play. What I think I want to do, and will keep me busy, busier, forensically work out what happened later, not yet.</p>

<p>I have often fallen short, in image and content. The work is not knitted up and varnished, and that hurts its impression, and feeds my insecurity, but it reflects the process. I need to digest urgency when it comes and run. It’s how I made my largest things, body scaled, for my enormous pointy body. Build it fast then stand or lie dazed days atop or within. </p>

<p>I have heard good advice but postponed its taking.</p>

<p>The audience is always there, and it takes willpower not to look and joke. I want to be an individual and a collaborator (and a friend and a technician and a facilitator and a teacher and a poet and) and there are only just the daylit hours. It’s impossible to know what I actually want to do because it changes when you measure it, and I keep stopping and thinking when I am sick of doing</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(upbeat imagined rhythm)</p>
<p>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“I love to perform,</p>
<p>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI perform every day</p>
<p>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy whole life is a performance</p>
<p>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI don’t know who I am anymore”</p>
<p>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*laughter*</p>
<p>possibly slightly misremembered.</p>
<p>A relevant story:</p>
<p>I don’t usually repeat (formalised) performances but I play my songs over and over and over on the piano to nobody or somebody sometimes. I have always liked voids, like train stations and twitter and empty living rooms. If my parents had come to any of my shows they’d recognise every song from the low-passed renditions from sometimes the next room but never the same but they didn’t. They wouldn’t know the words. It probably would have been a different setlist. Both their birthdays fall in these months, and as I write this we are still within the thirty-six-day window in which they’re both fifty years old.</p>
