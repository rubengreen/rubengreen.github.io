    With three boys<br/>
    You beat the odds at one in eight<br/><br/>

    And I can hear you saying<br/>
    "I would have loved a daughter"<br/><br/>

    Was I held as your daughter would be held?<br/>
    Did I cry like your daughter would have cried?<br/><br/>

    You wanted a daughter?<br/>
    I will be your daughter plait my hair.<br/><br/>

    You wanted a daughter?<br/>
    I will be your daughter plait my hair.<br/><br/>

    With one love<br/>
    You beat the odds at got knows what.<br/><br/>

    And I know it's hard,<br/>
    He's not that empathetic<br/>
    He has a heart<br/>
    But struggles to access it, express it<br/><br/>

    And he expects emotional labour from you!<br/>
    And it's not fair,<br/>
    We're all capable<br/>
    But boys don't learn<br/><br/>

    Did you teach me?<br/>
