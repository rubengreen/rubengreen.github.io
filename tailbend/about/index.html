      <b>Sophie Mak-Schram</b> has a background in art history and curatorial projects. She organises an annual experimental exhibition, An Overheard Map of Now, which works as an art-version of Chinese whispers; artists take up short residencies where their brief is simply to respond to the work the previous artist created. Other ongoing projects include The Answer Archive, an installation-performance collecting answers to unasked questions, and working with the Cera Project on international, ethno-cultural exhibitions.  <br/>
      <br/>
      Her curatorial and performance work is concerned with experience and audience, and how the position of art and artists can be explored to alter these. Through time-based performances, site-specific installations and collaborative work, she seeks to create spaces (literal or not) that disrupt the regimented format art history can impose on interaction. In frequent collaboration, she creates live installations and performances that involve, reimagine and question the boundaries between the maker and the audience.<br/>

      <b>Ruben Green</b> is a musician, poet, and performance artist, whose work attempts to unpack inbetweennesses, often through writing and performing texts.  <br/>
      <br/>
      They are generally uncomfortable with classification and definability, preferring to explore, or hide in, transitional spaces. They believe inbetweeness is political, where language seeks to categorise. Extract meaning from context to infinity. Forget their name, their title, their identification, their self description. Learn them by watching.  <br/>
      <br/>
      Recent shows + performances include Pornceptual does about:blank, Berlin, <i>Oyropean Dream</i> at Gala'rie Insolite, London, <i>Between</i> at 14th Cinema, London, and <i>A Space to Call Your Own/Cocoon</i> at Athens U-Kave, Athens.<br/>
      <br/>
      Their second album <i>Curtains</i> will be released in late 2017.<br/>
