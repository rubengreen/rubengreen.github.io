<p>I have settled, for now, on “non-essentialist”. If I had to pick one descriptor/theme/axiom of what I’m doing.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about pre-existing forms art takes, forms with conventions. Which is of course all forms, but for example I used to hold this typical opinionated art student view that painting was a waste of time, because as soon as you break conventions in any meaningful way (or at least in any of the ways I thought were interesting) it seemed to no longer resemble painting. I guess because it’s a definition based on a material, it’s equivalent in sculpture might be carving marble or something?</p>
<p>But anyway there’s an incredibly naïve implicit assumption there that art has to break conventions on every axis to be interesting. Which is hypocritical on my part. I am close to finishing an album of 14 songy songs that’s about 45 minutes, a vinyl-record-long. I don’t even own any vinyls. I’m making it because the album is a convention that’s meaningful to me, albums have moved me. And some people just like paintings made of paint or filmy films or proper theatery plays</p>
<p>There’s a part of my brain that wants to to convince the world that I’m proper transgressive by reframing my music as contemporary art, where suddenly I’m breaking all kinds of convention. It can’t be shown well in a gallery setting, and art people don’t know how to analyse it. Like I am trying to make my work inaccessible for edgy credibility. It’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Non essentialist” helps me avoid slipping into this kind of nonsense because it doesn’t say fuck convention. Knowing convention is really important. So you can ignore it or follow it. Perhaps with the former the default, but the latter more than permitted. Its where the meaning lies, or at least access to it.</p>
<p>Trans is also a useful prefix.</p>
<p>Transgression,</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp of boundaries, </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp create a soup</br>
Translation between in- and out- and neithersiders</br>
Transgender and cisgender have no boundary,</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp be non-non-binary, </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp non to the non to the non</br>
Transposition to the parallel minor, </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp where my fingers land, </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp cheesy by its context</br>
Transient, blink and you miss it,</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp forget me</br>
Transit where it's easiest to write</p>
<p>Trans is everywhere now, for good reason. Movement is easier to conceptualise than static inbetweenness. You can pinpoint its location if you don’t know its velocity, an uncertainty principle, keeping outsiders uncertain. Trans’ definition is slowing to a stop, confusingly. A tube stuck in a tunnel. How autological.</p>
<p>I am treating my role as an artist as to avoid fitting into this sentence’s description.</p>
<p>Inbetweeness is political, where language seeks to categorise. Context is meaning. Forget my name, my title, my identification, my self description, I want you to learn me by watching.</p>
<p>But I’m writing more and more. It’s a weird, self-destructive MO. I am trying to find a semantic world for all of this indefinability. Somewhere I can operate sincerely, less mediated. I never think it’s possible when the page is blank, but I usually end up liking it somehow.</p>
<p>Songs are much harder though.</p>
