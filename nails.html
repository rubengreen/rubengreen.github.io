      <p>Self proclaimed songstress <strong>Rubie</strong>’s debut album <i>Take Both</i>  is a manifesto for slipperiness - a soup-swimming experimental oddysey through gender & queer relationships. The album was painstakingly assembled over three years from recordings made at their south London home studio, at Hackney’s Total Refreshment Centre, and across the city in the form of phone voice memos.</p>
      <p>Rubie’s solo debut comes after a year cementing themselves in the most vibrant corners of the London music scene - as a member of <strong>Jenny Moore’s Mystic Business</strong> and <strong>F*Choir</strong>, and singing backing vocals on 2019 releases by <strong>Flamingods</strong> and <strong>Trash Kit</strong>.</p>
      <p>Debut single<i><strong> Nails </strong></i>showcases Rubie’s collage production style, opening with a sample of the voice memo, recorded on the street, that began the song three years ago. From there we are taken through segments of close recorded piano balladry, reverb laden ambient swash, wonky distorted drums, and a grandiose jazz-trio-come-piano-rock finale.</p>
      <p>Rubie says of the song - <br/>“<i>Nails began in the conversations I had as I first started to present myself as gender nonconforming. I found people were often super worried for me, and saw immense bravery in little public actions, like painting my nails on the tube. And those actions are brave. But I’m not sure they understood how those little things make me feel safer; the nail polish is armour, protecting fragile imperfect insides</i>.”</p>

        <p><strong>More about <i>Take Both:</i></strong></p>
      </div>
      <p><i>Take Both</i> is the debut solo album by songstress and artist <strong>Rubie</strong> (Jenny Moore’s Mystic Business, F*Choir). Tackling a gender-divided world, <i>Take Both</i> is a radical and personal manifesto for rejecting binary choices and complicating your thinking.</p>
      <p>Graduating in sculpture at Central St. Martins in 2019, Rubie’s approach to music is patchwork and hands on. <i>Take Both</i> was assembled in their living room studio from home recordings, sampled mobile phone voice memos and public group singing exercises. Centering their voice, Rubie’s writing starts with a-capella sketches, fleshed out through live experiments with an eclectic but minimal toolkit of sounds; A process flexible enough to produce the twitchy math-pop of <i><strong>Whole</strong></i>, to the blissful choral drones of <i><strong>Anatomy</strong></i>, or the crashy distorted experimental rock of <i><strong>The Need</strong></i>.</p><p>Half of the tracks feature drums by <strong>Kit Denison</strong> (Albatross Archive), recorded in a day at Total Refreshment Centre with <strong>Capitol K</strong>, who Rubie had previously worked with recording vocals on Trash Kit’s 2019 release Horizon. Since they started playing together in the summer of 2018, Kit’s versatile and sensitive playing has become a crucial part of Rubie’s live sound. Tracks like <i><strong>A Polychotomy To Make Sense of a Soup</strong></i> and <i><strong>Nails</strong></i> spend long sections pared down entirely to Kit’s percussion and Rubie’s vocal; the dry and visceral minimal arrangement is pushed to its limit so as to make the lush, maximal sections feel enormous.</p>
      <p>Title track <strong>Take Both </strong>sets a hypnotic and abstract mission statement for the record; originally conceived as a choral composition, three braided layers of Rubie’s voice sing “I was taken to overcome my programming and take both”. It reads as an account of a damascene moment where Rubie realised they didn't have to choose. </p>
      <p>"<i>Take Both</i> is a mantra I think the world could live by", Rubie says. "I can only sing from my perspective, but hope that my work can at least be an example an ongoing unpicking, a deprogramming of those human thought patterns that might be holding us back."</p>
      <p>And it's this subjectivity that lends the album its heart - as much as the album sets out to abstractly philosophise about gender, it’s Rubie’s most bare and personal writing - the a-capella <strong>Be Your Daughter Plait My Hair </strong>or subtle soup-sailing closer <strong>Sailors</strong> - that really brings their worldview home.</p><br/>
