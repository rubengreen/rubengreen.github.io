      <p><b>a letter</b><p>
      <p>You sailed until you found an island<br/>
        To live on<br/>
        And I am in your waters<br/>
        Your demarcated territory in this fucking soup<br/>
        And I'm scared i wont find my island in it and that one day I'll have to leave<br/>
<br/>
        I thought you would be the easiest person to talk to about myself<br/>
        And you are becoming that person quickly, and you teach me to be honester, <br/>
        I am coming along leaps and bounds<br/>
        I value your experience and your willingness to share it so much<br/>
        You have already taught me endless wisdom in our few weeks<br/>
        But even if it might be obvious to you from implication, a part of me just cant tell you straight <br/>
        That I often can’t close my eyes n pay attention to myself and find a man in there<br/>
<br/>
        I keep trying to casually mention that I’ve seriously considered transition and that it still crosses my mind occasionally and it doesn't come out <br/>
<br/>
        I think I dress less femme for you subconciously and I want to stop<br/>
<br/>
        When I was seventeen I dreamed desperately of leaving home because I thought my family was stopping me from being myself<br/>
        But it was always impractical and I back burnered it<br/>
        And became a nocturnal crossdressing songwriter, pfff<br/>
        But it turns out <br/>
        as I’ve slowly pushed the edges of the space they gave me<br/>
        they would always try to make me room <br/>
        even if I don't explain much to them<br/>
        And I should learn from that, and push harder<br/>
<br/>
        In berlin I was different probably? I felt comfortable enough to write “A polychotomy to make sense of a soup”, to proudly declare myself to be in legitimate nonbinary person uniform, and now I'm back I feel weird singing it<br/>
<br/>
        I dodge the language of queer identity because it scares me, feels like a commitment<br/>
<br/>
        Would you find space for me in your ocean territory if I found I cant really be your man?<br/>
        If it turns out I can't sustain maaaaaaanhood?<br/>
        Because I so want to stay here, &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, in your gorgeous coves<br/>
<br/>
        I decided to drop my surname in song<br/>
        I was walking in notting hill<br/>
        Your ends<br/>
        Singing into my phone:<br/>
        "I gave my name to my band<br/>
        So you can call me Rubie now"<br/>
<br/>
        Rubie roo Green, fronts Ruben. The wikipedia description.<br/>
<br/>
        Frontman or Woman or Other or none of the above<br/>
<br/>
        I told ophelia to dodge pronouns entirely when she introduced my act but hiding is unsustainable and my name’s not much better <br/>
        sometimes I want to say to just fucking point at me when you want to refer to me bc thats at least objective and I’ll never change my mind on it<br/>
<br/>
        I'm a pragmatic girl<br/>
        I don't believe the decision to transition is made in a vacuum<br/>
        I've never been androgynous or ambiguous and couldn't be and don’t want to be because I don’t think I should have to be<br/>
        I am happier than I've ever been right now<br/>
<br/>
        The hes dont usually bother me<br/>
        And theys make me so uncomfortably self aware<br/>
        "its not about pronouns for me"<br/>
        and its not I guess? <br/>
        I feel so blessedly validated by the people I surround myself with to not feel the need to expect anything more of them, honestly<br/>
        They make space for me too<br/>
<br/>
        When a lovely thoughtful person calls me they of their own accord it makes me ask 'what do I want' and I don't know the answer<br/>
<br/>
        “he”<br/>
        And my given name<br/>
        Are easy <br/>
        because I was handed them<br/>
        "the cards I was dealt"<br/>
        A phrase implying lack of control<br/>
        Which is what I feel as someone who can’t be a beautiful girl<br/>
        when the fleeting desire to be one takes me<br/>
<br/>
        (As an aside to this long note to you/me/us? I wanna also tell myself v individually and directly: <br/>
        this fucking crunchy messy bullshit feeling right now legitimises your transness in whatever form it takes, ruben thorniley green, however much you feel like a fucking fraud in the morning, so go n be fucking queer please if nothing else)<br/>

        The Morning Update:<br/>
        I don’t want to change my name now<br/>
        Sometimes I feel like I’m only trans after 2am<br/>
        In the hours I used to dress in secret<br/>
        like some sort of weird womanhood werewolf<br/>
        or the shrek princess<br/>
<br/>
        The language still makes me wince but I guess this is literally the definition of genderfluid?<br/>
<br/>
        Drunk on insomnia last night<br/>
        I really thought I’d send you this right away, somehow<br/>
<br/>
        I don’t know how I’m going to feel tomorrow I will probably be satisfied again<br/>
        I forget the subjective experience of these weird queer nights<br/>
        And for weeks at a time<br/>
        I am honestly satisfied in my ironic reluctant-maleness<br/>
<br/>
        I am going to leave this letter some time before you read it, probably,<br/>
        So please don’t take anything in it seriously wrt my current feelings<br/>
        I’ve resisted the urge to edit much because I want immediacy and I don’t want to construct a fiction<br/>
        It’s like we talked about with songwriting<br/>
        I can only capture how I am right now<br/>
        (11th September 2017, between 02:00 and 12:00)<br/>
        and at other times I am definitely different<br/>
        these things come in waves, atop this ocean soup<br/>
        treacherous for my little boat<br/>
<br/>
        but basically &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; if you do read this it’ll be because I want to know for sure I can be like this and with you, and like this with you<br/>
        I want to learn to be direct and not be scared<br/>
<br/>
        I want to give you a telescope<br/>
        so you can watch out for me from your paradise shores<br/>
        while I sail about haphazardly<br/>
        for an island of my own<br/></p>
